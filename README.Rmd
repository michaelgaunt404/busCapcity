This repo contains functions to simulate the operation of bus berth stations and to provide the user with summary statistics given their inputs. 

The main data product resulting from this work is an online dashboard that transpiration practitioners can access this tool with.

With the dashboard, transportation practitioners can:

+ Simulate a number of bus routes 
+ Provide simulation parameters regarding passenger and bus behaviour 
+ Define bus berth and exit constraints 
+ Retrieve summary statistics 
+ Retrieve simulated data

And all without having to know how to code, cool!
